In this project, you will set up a local monitoring system using Docker, Grafana, and Prometheus. This setup will allow you to collect metrics and visualize them in a dashboard.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine.
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of your project.
- Set up Prometheus as the metrics collection system.
- Configure Grafana as the visualization tool.
- Create a simple dashboard in Grafana to display system metrics.
- Add a sample application to monitor, such as a simple web server.

Your `docker-compose.yml` file should define services for:
1. Prometheus
2. Grafana
3. A sample application to monitor

## Steps

1. Create the `docker-compose.yml` file with services for Prometheus and Grafana.
2. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics (you'll need a `prometheus.yml` configuration file).
3. Set up Grafana to use Prometheus as a data source.
4. Create a simple dashboard in Grafana to display metrics.
5. Use `docker-compose up` to start your monitoring stack.
6. Access Grafana through your web browser and verify that metrics are being collected and displayed.

You can learn more about Prometheus [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) and Grafana [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/).

<hr />

For a more advanced version of this project, consider adding alerting rules in Prometheus, setting up additional exporters to collect more diverse metrics, or monitoring a multi-container application.
