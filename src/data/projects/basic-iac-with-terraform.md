In this project, you will use Terraform to provision a virtual machine in AWS.

## Requirements

- Install Terraform on your local machine.
- Set up an account with a AWS and obtain necessary credentials.
- Create a `main.tf` file in the root directory of your project.
- Write Terraform configuration to provision a basic resource (e.g., an EC2 instance on AWS or a VM on Azure).
- Use Terraform commands to initialize, plan, apply, and destroy your infrastructure.
- The provisioned resource should be accessible and verifiable in your cloud provider's console.

You can learn more about Terraform basics [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform).

<hr />

For a more advanced version of this project, consider adding multiple resources, using variables and outputs, or implementing a modular structure for your Terraform configuration.
