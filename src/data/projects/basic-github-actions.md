In this project, you will write a basic HTML file and setup a GitHub Actions workflow to test, build & deploy it to GitHub Pages.

## Requirements

- Create a simple HTML file (the content is up to you)
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow that will test, build & deploy the website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Failures in the workflow should be clearly indicated and failures will halt the workflow
- The workflow should be in the `.github/workflows` directory
- The workflow file should be named `main.yml`

<hr />

If you are looking to build a more advanced version of this project, you can either create a more advanced Astro website or you can build a more advanced GitHub Actions workflow.
