# Basics of Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering in cybersecurity is the process of analyzing a software program or hardware component to understand its design, functionality, and operation, often without access to the original source code or technical documentation. This technique is commonly used to dissect malware to uncover its behavior, identify vulnerabilities, and develop mitigation strategies. By deconstructing the code, security professionals can trace the steps the software takes, determine its intent, and neutralize its harmful effects. Reverse engineering also plays a crucial role in assessing the security of proprietary systems, enabling the identification of weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers, and ensuring that systems are resilient against cyber threats.
