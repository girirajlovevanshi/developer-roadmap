# Basics of IDS and IPS

## What is Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security solution designed to monitor network traffic or system activities for signs of malicious behavior or policy violations. By analyzing the flow of data and comparing it against known patterns of attacks or anomalies, an IDS can detect unauthorized access attempts, malware infiltration, and other security breaches in real time. When a potential threat is identified, the IDS generates alerts for security personnel, allowing them to take swift action to mitigate the risk. IDS can be categorized into two main types: Network-based IDS (NIDS), which monitors network traffic, and Host-based IDS (HIDS), which focuses on individual devices or servers. While an IDS is effective in identifying potential threats, it typically does not take direct action to block attacks, making it an important part of a broader security strategy that includes proactive defenses like firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).

## What is Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)?

An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security tool designed to detect and prevent malicious activities by actively monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Unlike an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which only alerts security personnel to potential threats, an IPS takes immediate action to block or mitigate those threats in real-time. It does this by examining the content of network packets and comparing them against known attack signatures, behavioral patterns, or anomaly-based rules. If a threat is detected, the IPS can automatically drop malicious packets, reset connections, or reconfigure firewall settings to prevent the attack from succeeding. As a proactive defense mechanism, an IPS is crucial for protecting networks against a wide range of cyber threats, including viruses, worms, and unauthorized access attempts.
