# Basics of NAS and SAN

Network Attached Storage (NAS) and Storage Area Network (SAN) technologies play a crucial role in managing data within an organization and serve as the building blocks for a more comprehensive IT infrastructure.

## Network Attached Storage (NAS)

NAS is a high-capacity storage solution that operates on a data file level, allowing multiple users and clients to access, store, and retrieve data from a centralized location over a network. NAS devices are generally connected to a local area network (LAN) and use various file-sharing protocols, such as NFS (Network File System), SMB/CIFS (Server Message Block/Common Internet File System), or AFP (Apple Filing Protocol).

## Storage Area Network (SAN)

SAN is a high-performance, dedicated storage network designed to provide block-level data storage for applications and servers. Unlike NAS, which uses file-sharing protocols, SANs utilize block-based protocols such as Fibre Channel (FC) and iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) to handle storage requests.
