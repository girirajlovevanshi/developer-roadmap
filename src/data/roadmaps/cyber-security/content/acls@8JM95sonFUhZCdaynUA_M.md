# ACLs

Access Control Lists are rule sets that define which user, group, or system has access to specific resources and determine what type of access they have (e.g., read or write). ACLs act as a barrier to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems; this can help maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your organization's critical assets.

There are two primary types of ACLs: Discretionary and Mandatory.

- **Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs)**  
  DACLs allow the owner of a resource to determine who can gain access to the resource, and the level of access they can have. For example, a user or a group of users may have read access rights to a particular file, whereas another group may have full control over the file.

- **Mandatory Access Control Lists (MACLs)**  
  MACLs rely on predefined security labels or classifications to enforce access control. In this case, resources are assigned security labels, and users or systems are given security clearances. Access is granted only if the user's security clearance level matches the resource label.
