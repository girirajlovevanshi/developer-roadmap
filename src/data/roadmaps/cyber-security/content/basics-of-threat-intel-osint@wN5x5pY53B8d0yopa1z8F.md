# Basics of Threat Intel, OSINT

Threat intelligence involves the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information about potential or current threats to an organizationâ€™s security. This intelligence is used to understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of cyber adversaries, enabling organizations to proactively defend against attacks. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a key component of threat intelligence, involving the gathering of publicly available information from sources such as social media, forums, websites, and public records. OSINT helps identify potential threats, discover vulnerabilities, and monitor adversarial activities by leveraging the vast amount of data accessible on the internet. Together, threat intelligence and OSINT provide a comprehensive view of the threat landscape, allowing organizations to anticipate and mitigate risks before they materialize into actual incidents.
