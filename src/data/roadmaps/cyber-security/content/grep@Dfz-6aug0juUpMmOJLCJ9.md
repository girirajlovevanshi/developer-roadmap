# grep

Grep is a powerful command-line tool used for searching and filtering text, primarily in Unix-based systems. Short for "global regular expression print", grep is widely used for its ability to search through files and directories, and find lines that match a given pattern. It is particularly useful for incident response and discovery tasks, as it helps you identify specific occurrences of potentially malicious activities within large amounts of log data.
