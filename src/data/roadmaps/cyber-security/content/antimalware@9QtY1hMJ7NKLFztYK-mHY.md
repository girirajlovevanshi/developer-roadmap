# Anti-malware

Anti-malware is a type of software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software, such as viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware, from computer systems. By continuously scanning files, applications, and incoming data, anti-malware solutions protect devices from a wide range of threats that can compromise system integrity, steal sensitive information, or disrupt operations. Advanced anti-malware programs utilize real-time monitoring, heuristic analysis, and behavioral detection techniques to identify and neutralize both known and emerging threats, ensuring that systems remain secure against evolving cyber attacks.
