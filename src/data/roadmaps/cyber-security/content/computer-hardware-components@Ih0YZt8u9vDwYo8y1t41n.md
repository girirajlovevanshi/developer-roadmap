# Computer Hardware Components

Computer hardware components form the physical foundation of information systems and play a crucial role in cybersecurity. 

The central processing unit (CPU) executes instructions and can be vulnerable to side-channel attacks. Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores data and programs, potentially exposing sensitive information if not properly cleared. Storage devices like hard drives and solid-state drives hold persistent data and can be targets for data theft or encryption attacks. Motherboards connect all components and may contain vulnerabilities in firmware or embedded controllers. Network interface cards facilitate communication and can be exploited for unauthorized access. Input/output devices such as keyboards, mice, and displays can be compromised to capture user data. Graphics processing units (GPUs) have emerged as potential security risks due to their computational power and potential for cryptomining malware. Understanding these components and their security implications is essential for implementing comprehensive hardware-level security measures and protecting against physical and digital threats.
