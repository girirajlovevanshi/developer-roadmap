ARP is a crucial network protocol used to map IP addresses to their corresponding MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. This mapping is crucial, as devices on a network use MAC addresses to communicate with one another. As IP addresses are easier to remember and utilize for humans, ARP helps in converting these logical addresses to physical addresses that devices can understand.
