# Blue Team vs Red Team vs Purple Team

In cybersecurity, Blue Team and Red Team refer to opposing groups that work together to improve an organization's security posture. The Blue Team represents defensive security personnel who protect systems and networks from attacks, while the Red Team simulates real-world adversaries to test the Blue Team's defenses. Purple Team bridges the gap between the two, facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing to enhance overall security effectiveness. This approach combines the defensive strategies of the Blue Team with the offensive tactics of the Red Team, creating a more comprehensive and dynamic security framework that continuously evolves to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
