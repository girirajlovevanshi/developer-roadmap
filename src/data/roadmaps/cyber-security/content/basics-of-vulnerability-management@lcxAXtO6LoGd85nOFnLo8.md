# Basics of Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management is the continuous process of identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities within an organization's IT infrastructure. This process begins with the regular scanning of systems, networks, and applications to detect vulnerabilitiesâ€”weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. Once identified, these vulnerabilities are assessed based on their severity, potential impact, and the likelihood of exploitation. Prioritization is crucial, as it helps organizations focus on addressing the most critical vulnerabilities first. Remediation involves applying patches, updates, or other security controls to eliminate the vulnerabilities. Effective vulnerability management is essential for reducing the attack surface, ensuring compliance with security standards, and maintaining the overall security posture of the organization.
